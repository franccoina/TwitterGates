# Twitter Gates

This repository contains the base development of an academic mobile application project built with Flutter. It is designed as a single evolving project that grows progressively in structure, functionality, and complexity throughout the course.

Instead of creating separate projects for each stage, this repository follows a continuous development approach. The goal is to understand how a real-world application is structured internally — including navigation, state management, UI organization, and theming — while gradually shaping it into a social media–style app.

This project serves as a practical learning environment focused on modern mobile development patterns, clean architecture, and scalable design using Flutter.
